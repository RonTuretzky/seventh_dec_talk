## Key Narrative Differences

| Skeleton 1: "Escape Hatch" | Skeleton 2: "Builder's Pitch" |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Emotional-first | Evidence-first |
| Crisis → Hope → Action | Experience → Ecosystem → Role |
| Targets: disillusioned seekers | Targets: builders, crypto-native |
| Shorter, punchier | More detailed, technical |
| Leads with spiritual prison | Leads with lived kibbutz experience |
| 12 slides | 14 slides |

## Recommended Approach

For **Decentral Park** (7 rating) audience: Use Skeleton 2 (builder-oriented, crypto-native)

For **general/emotional** audience: Use Skeleton 1 (escape narrative, accessible)

Both decks front-load the 10-rated topics and minimize or cut the lower-rated material (planned econ comparisons, hybrid economies, communet, p2p2p).
